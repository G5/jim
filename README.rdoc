= TODO
 * Write a README
 * Describe proper regex definition in a YAML file: http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/159/use-of-a-regex-stored-inside-yaml-file
 * Note that it requires 2.1. It's not that bad to make it work on earlier Ruby's but we really don't care.
 * Mention the rspec helpers and metadata and that garbage.
 * Mention permanently_disabled and how maybe it doesn't work all the time with class-level stuff that reloads.
